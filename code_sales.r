In many cases, we build models not only to predict, but also to gain insight from the data. When,  we performed the RandomForest Algorithm, we saw that the Item_MRP seemed to be an important predictor. Well, the model confirmed it: this variable was the most statistically significant in the linear model, was one of the most important variable  used to predict in the regression tree, and the one that reduced the estimated error the most in the random forest.
